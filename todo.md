## Known Issues / Bugs
- [ ] Walk controller state re-renders the entire `Map` tree every animation frame
- [ ] `Realistic3DAvatars` rebuilds huge `innerHTML` strings and audio graphs every frame
- [ ] HUD distance readouts label raw meter values as "km"
- [ ] Mapbox init hook logs token existence/length/preview to the console
- [ ] Heatmap toggle is exposed in the sidebar but `HeatmapLayer` is still a stub
